        Report an illegal driving instructor
      </h1>

      <p>It’s illegal for someone to charge for driving lessons if they are not qualified and registered - you can report them to the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA).</p>
      
      <p>The only people who can charge a fee to give driving lessons are:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>approved driving instructors - they must display a green badge in their windscreen</li>
        <li>trainee driving instructors with a licence - they must display a pink badge in their windscreen</li>
      </ul>

      {{ govukInsetText({
        html: detailsHTML
      }) }}

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Report an illegal driving instructor</h2>
      <p>Contact DVSA to report the illegal driving instructor. You can do this anonymously (not giving your name) or give your details.:</p>
      <p>You need to give as much information as possible about:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the illegal driving instructor</li>
        <li>the vehicle involved, including the registration number (number plate) if you know it</li>
        <li>where it happened</li>
        <li>when it happened</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Reporting something anonymously</h3>
      <p>If you report something anonymously:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>you’ll never be asked for your name or to provide contact details</li>
        <li>your call will not be traced</li>
        <li>you will not have to make a statement or be called as a witness</li>
        <li>you will not have to appear in court</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Depending on what you’re reporting, it might be possible for the illegal driving instructor to work out that you reported it - even if you report it anonymously.</p>
     
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you do give your contact details</h3>
      <p>You can remain anonymous. However, if you give DVSA your contact details you might:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>be contacted for more information</li>
        <li>be asked to provide a statement</li>
        <li>have to act as a witness and appear in court</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Report online</h3>
      <p>Report an illegal driving instructor using the online form.</p>

      {{ govukButton({
        text: "Start now",
        href: "data-protection",
        isStartButton: true
      }) }}

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Alternatively, email or call the DVSA to report an illegal driving instructor</h3>
      <p>DVSA Intelligence Unit</br>
        <a href="#" class="govuk-link">enquiries@dvsa.gov.uk</a><br>
        Telephone: 0800 030 4103</br>
        Monday to Friday, 7:30am to 6pm</br>
        <a href="#" class="govuk-link">Find out about call charges</a></p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
      <p>DVSA will review the information and decide what to do next.</p>
      <p>This could include:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>investigating the report further</li>
        <li>asking you for more information if you did not make the report anonymously</li>
        <li>working with other government departments and agencies or the police</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Getting feedback on what happened</h2>
      <p>If you ask DVSA to give you feedback on what happened with a criminal prosecution, you’ll get it when:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>any investigation and criminal or other official proceedings have ended</li>
        <li>a decision has been made if the person appeals against their verdict</li>
      </ul>
      <p>DVSA cannot give feedback on an ongoing case. Criminal investigations can take time.</p>
