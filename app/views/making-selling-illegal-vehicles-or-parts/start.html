        Report someone making or selling unsafe or illegal vehicles or parts
      </h1>

      <p class="govuk-body-l">Report a manufacturer or a dealer for making or selling new vehicles, vehicle parts and vehicle accessories with safety problems.</p>
      <hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

      <p>You can report a vehicle manufacturer, supplier, dealer or private seller if you think they’re breaking the law.</p>
      
      <p>This includes if they’re:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>selling new vehicles, trailers or non-road mobile machinery that have not been approved to the right <a href="#" class="govuk-link">safety and environmental standards</a></li>
        <li>selling new accessories that do not meet safety standards, such as <a href="#" class="govuk-link">motorcycle helmets</a> or child car seats</li>
        <li>using vehicles that are not safe to drive (unroadworthy)</li>
        <li>selling new parts that do not meet safety standards (known as type approval) - this includes parts sold in the aftermarket that may not be original to the vehicle</li>
        <li>offering to remove or change emission control systems, such as diesel particulate filters and catalytic converters</li>
      </ul>

      {{ govukInsetText({
        text: "There’s a different process to report a safety defect with your vehicle, vehicle part or accessory."
      }) }}

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Report the business or person</h2>
      <p>You need to give as much information as possible about:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the name of the business or person who is involved</li>
        <li>what the business or person is doing</li>
        <li>where they’re making or selling vehicles or parts, which could include links to online listings</li>
        <li>the vehicles involved, including the registration plates (number plates) if you know them</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Reporting something anonymously</h3>
      <p>If you report something anonymously:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>you’ll never be asked for your name or to provide contact details</li>
        <li>your call will not be traced</li>
        <li>you will not have to make a statement or be called as a witness</li>
        <li>you will not have to appear in court</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Depending on what you’re reporting, it might be possible for the business or person to work out that you reported it - even if you report it anonymously.</p>
     
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you do give your contact details</h3>
      <p>You can remain anonymous. However, if you give DVSA your contact details you might:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>be contacted for more information</li>
        <li>be asked to provide a statement</li>
        <li>have to act as a witness and appear in court</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Read the <a href="#" class="govuk-link">privacy notice for reporting a vehicle manufacturer or supplier</a> to find out more about how your details are stored and used.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Report online</h3>
      <p>Report the company or person using the online form.</p>

      {{ govukButton({
        text: "Start now",
        href: "new",
        isStartButton: true
      }) }}

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Contact DVSA</h3>
      <p>Alternatively, contact DVSA to make your report.</p>

        <a href="#" class="govuk-link">enquiries@dvsa.gov.uk</a><br>
        Telephone: 0800 030 4103</br>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
      <p>DVSA will review the information and decide what to do next.</p>
      <p>This could include:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>investigating the report further</li>
        <li>asking you for more information if you did not make the report anonymously</li>
        <li>working with other government departments and agencies or the police</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Getting feedback on what happened</h2>
      <p>If you ask DVSA to give you feedback on what happened with a criminal prosecution, you’ll get it when:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>any investigation and criminal or other official proceedings have ended</li>
        <li>a decision has been made if the person appeals against their verdict</li>
      </ul>
      <p>DVSA cannot give feedback on an ongoing case. Criminal investigations can take time.</p>
