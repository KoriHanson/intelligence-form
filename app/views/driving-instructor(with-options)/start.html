      Report an illegal driving instructor
    </h1>

    <p>It’s illegal for someone to charge for driving lessons if they are not qualified and registered - you can report them to the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA).</p>
    
    <p>The only people who can charge a fee to give driving lessons are:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>approved driving instructors - they must display a green badge in their windscreen</li>
      <li>trainee driving instructors with a licence - they must display a pink badge in their windscreen</li>
    </ul>

    {{ govukInsetText({
      html: detailsHTML
    }) }}

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Report an illegal driving instructor</h2>
    <p>Contact DVSA to report the illegal driving instructor. You can do this anonymously (not giving your name) or give your details.:</p>
    <p>You need to give as much information as possible about:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the illegal driving instructor</li>
      <li>the vehicle involved, including the registration number (number plate) if you know it</li>
      <li>where it happened</li>
      <li>when it happened</li>
    </ul>
