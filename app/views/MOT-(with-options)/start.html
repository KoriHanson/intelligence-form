      <p>You can report an MOT test, tester or centre to the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) if you think they’re breaking the law. This includes if they are:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>giving an MOT certificate to a vehicle they know should have failed</li>
        <li>giving an MOT certificate to a vehicle they have not tested</li>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Report an MOT test, tester or garage</h2>
      <p>Contact DVSA to report the MOT test, tester or garage. You can do this anonymously (not giving your name) or give your details.</p>
      <p>You need to give as much information as possible about:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>who’s involved</li>
        <li>what the MOT tester or garage has been doing</li>
        <li>where it happened</li>
        <li>when it happened</li>
        <li>the vehicles involved, including the registration numbers (number plates) if you know them</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Reporting something anonymously</h3>
      <p>If you report something anonymously:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>you’ll never be asked for your name or to provide contact details</li>
        <li>your call will not be traced</li>
        <li>you will not have to make a statement or be called as a witness</li>
        <li>you will not have to appear in court</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Depending on what you’re reporting, it might be possible for the MOT tester or garage to work out that you reported it - even if you report it anonymously.</p>
     
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you do give your contact details</h3>
      <p>You can remain anonymous. However, if you give DVSA your contact details you might:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>be contacted for more information</li>
        <li>be asked to provide a statement</li>
        <li>have to act as a witness and appear in court</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
      <p>DVSA will review the information and decide what to do next.</p>
      <p>This could include:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>investigating the report further</li>
        <li>asking you for more information if you did not make the report anonymously</li>
        <li>working with other government departments and agencies or the police</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Depending on how serious the offence is the tester or garage could be:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>banned from carrying out MOTs</li>
        <li>fined</li>
        <li>given a prison sentence</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Getting feedback on what happened</h2>
      <p>If you ask DVSA to give you feedback on what happened with a criminal prosecution, you’ll get it when:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>any investigation and criminal or other official proceedings have ended</li>
        <li>a decision has been made if the person appeals against their verdict</li>
      </ul>
      <p>DVSA cannot give feedback on an ongoing case. Criminal investigations can take time.</p>
