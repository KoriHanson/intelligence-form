      <hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What you can report to DVSA</h2>
      <p>You can report a van or Light Goods Vehicle driver or the business running the vehicles (a ‘vehicle operator’) to DVSA if you think they’re breaking safety rules or conditions of their driving or operator licence.</p>
      
      <p>This includes things like:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>breaking drivers’ hours rules</li>
        <li>overloading vehicles</li>
        <li>using vehicles that are not safe to drive (unroadworthy)</li>
        <li>using emission cheat devices</li>
        <li>carrying dangerous or hazardous goods without permission</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Reporting something anonymously</h3>
      <p>If you report something anonymously:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>you’ll never be asked for your name or to provide contact details</li>
        <li>your call will not be traced</li>
        <li>you will not have to make a statement or be called as a witness</li>
        <li>you will not have to appear in court</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Depending on what you’re reporting, it might be possible for the MOT tester or garage to work out that you reported it - even if you report it anonymously.</p>
     
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you do give your contact details</h3>
      <p>You can remain anonymous. However, if you give DVSA your contact details you might:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>be contacted for more information</li>
        <li>be asked to provide a statement</li>
        <li>have to act as a witness and appear in court</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Report online</h3>
      <p>Report the driver or business using the online form.</p>
