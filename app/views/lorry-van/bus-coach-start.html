      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Report a coach or bus driver or business</h2>
      <p>You can report a coach or bus driver or the business running the vehicles (a ‘vehicle operator’) to DVSA if you think they’re breaking safety rules or conditions of their driving or operator licence.</p>
      
      <p>This includes things like:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>breaking drivers’ hours rules</li>
        <li>overloading vehicles</li>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Issues you have to report to other organisations</h3>
      <p>Theres a different process to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><a href="#" class="govuk-link">report other crime</a>, such as suspected drink-driving, speeding and driving while disqualified</li>
        <li><a href="#" class="govuk-link">complain about scheduled bus services in London </a>arriving late, early, or not turning up at all</li>
        <li><a href="#" class="govuk-link">complain about scheduled bus services in Scotland</a>arriving late, early or not turning up at all</li>
        <li><a href="#" class="govuk-link">complain about bus and coach services in Northern Ireland</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Report bus driver rudeness</h3>
      <p>Complain directly to the bus or coach operator if their driver was rude to you. If you’re not happy with their response:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><a href="#" class="govuk-link">complain to Bus Users UK </a>, if the journey was in England (outside London), Scotland or Wales</li>
        <li><a href="#" class="govuk-link">complain to London TravelWatch</a> if the journey was in London</li>
        <li><a href="#" class="govuk-link">complain to the Consumer Council for Northern Ireland</a> if the journey was in Northern Ireland</li>
      </ul>
     
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Report the driver or business</h3>
      <p>Contact DVSA to report the driver or company. You can do this anonymously or give your details - <a href="#" class="govuk-link">check what this means before you make your report.</a></p>
      <p>You need to give as much information as possible about:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>who is involved - for example, the driver or company name, or the vehicle registration number (number plate)</li>
        <li>what the driver or company is doing</li>
        <li>where they’re doing it</li>
        <li>when they’re doing it</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Reporting something anonymously</h3>
      <p>If you report something anonymously:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>you’ll never be asked for your name or to provide contact details</li>
        <li>your call will not be traced</li>
        <li>you will not have to make a statement or be called as a witness</li>
        <li>you will not have to appear in court</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Depending on what you’re reporting, it might be possible for the MOT tester or garage to work out that you reported it - even if you report it anonymously.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you do give your contact details</h3>
      <p>You can remain anonymous. However, if you give DVSA your contact details you might:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>be contacted for more information</li>
        <li>be asked to provide a statement</li>
        <li>have to act as a witness and appear in court</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Report online</h3>
      <p>Report the driver or business using the online form.</p>

      {{ govukButton({
        text: "Start now",
        href: "data-protection",
        isStartButton: true
      }) }}

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Alternatively, contact DVSA to make your report</h3>
      <p>DVSA Intelligence Unit</br>
        <a href="#" class="govuk-link">enquiries@dvsa.gov.uk</a><br>
        Telephone: 0800 030 4103</br>
        Monday to Friday, 7:30am to 6pm</br>
        <a href="#" class="govuk-link">Find out about call charges</a></p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
        <p>DVSA will review the information and decide what to do next.</p>
        <p>This could include:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>investigating the report further</li>
          <li>asking you for more information if you did not make the report anonymously</li>
          <li>working with other government departments and agencies or the police</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Depending on how serious the offence is the tester or garage could be:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>banned from carrying out MOTs</li>
          <li>fined</li>
          <li>given a prison sentence</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Getting feedback on what happened</h2>
        <p>If you ask DVSA to give you feedback on what happened with a criminal prosecution, you’ll get it when:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>any investigation and criminal or other official proceedings have ended</li>
          <li>a decision has been made if the person appeals against their verdict</li>
        </ul>
        <p>DVSA cannot give feedback on an ongoing case. Criminal investigations can take time.</p>
